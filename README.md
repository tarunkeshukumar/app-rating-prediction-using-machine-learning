# Machine Learning Model for App Rating Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict the rating of an app based on its features. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Google Play Store Apps dataset, which includes various attributes of apps available on the Google Play Store.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Google Play Store Apps Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps). It contains features such as app name, category, rating, reviews, size, installs, type (free or paid), price, content rating, genres, last updated, current version, and Android version.

## Project Structure
- `data`: This directory contains the dataset file (`googleplaystore.csv`).
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `models`: Trained models and model artifacts will be saved in this directory.
- `src`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Place the `googleplaystore.csv` dataset file in the `data` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, and develop the machine learning model.
5. Alternatively, you can use the scripts in the `src` directory to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
6. The trained models and model artifacts will be saved in the `models` directory for future use.
